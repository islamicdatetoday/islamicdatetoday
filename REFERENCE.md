# References and Sources

This project documents Islamic calendar systems using information from:

- Official Saudi Umm Al Qura calendar publications
- Government and institutional calendar sources
- Astronomical calculation references
- Academic publications
- Publicly available reference materials (including Wikipedia and academic sources)

Each dataset and documentation file should indicate its specific source where applicable.

The goal of this project is to aggregate, standardize, and document existing systems, not to redefine them.
