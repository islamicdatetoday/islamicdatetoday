# Islamic Date

An Islamic date is a date expressed according to the Hijri calendar system, which is based on lunar months and is used in Islamic religious and civil contexts.

Islamic dates are commonly used to determine religious observances, historical events, and daily religious practices in many parts of the world.

Because the Hijri calendar is lunar, Islamic dates do not correspond to fixed seasons in the Gregorian calendar and shift earlier by approximately 10 to 11 days each Gregorian year.

IslamicDate.Today publishes Islamic date data in a standardized, machine-readable form for reference and informational purposes.
