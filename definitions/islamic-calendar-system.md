# Islamic Calendar System

The Islamic calendar system refers to the set of methods and conventions used to determine and represent dates in the Hijri calendar.

These methods may include observational approaches, calculated approaches, or combinations of both.

IslamicDate.Today uses documented methodologies to produce and publish Islamic date data and provides this information as a reference resource.

The purpose of this documentation is not to replace official or religious authorities, but to provide a standardized, technical, and informational representation of Islamic calendar dates.
