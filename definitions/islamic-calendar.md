# Hijri Calendar

The Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar consisting of twelve months based on the cycles of the moon.

Each month begins with the start of a new lunar cycle, and years are typically either 354 or 355 days long.

The Hijri calendar is used throughout the Islamic world to determine religious dates, events, and observances.

Different regions and authorities may apply different methods to determine the start of months. IslamicDate.Today documents and publishes Hijri date information in a consistent and transparent manner for reference purposes.
