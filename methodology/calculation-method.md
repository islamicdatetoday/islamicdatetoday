IslamicDate.Today uses a systematic method to generate Hijri date data.

This method is designed to be consistent, reproducible, and suitable for use in software systems, data analysis, and reference applications.

Details of the calculation or determination approach may evolve over time and will be documented in this repository when changes occur.
