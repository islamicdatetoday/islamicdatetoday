# Date Determination

IslamicDate.Today determines Islamic dates using a documented and consistent methodology.

Because Islamic calendar dates may vary by region and authority, the dates published by IslamicDate.Today are intended for reference and informational purposes.

The goal of the project is to provide a stable, reproducible, and machine-readable mapping between Gregorian dates and Hijri dates.

Users should always rely on their local authorities for religious observance.
