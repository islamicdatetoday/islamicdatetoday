# IslamicDate.Today

IslamicDate.Today is a reference platform for Islamic calendar systems and Hijri date data.

The project provides documentation, datasets, and methodological notes for multiple Islamic calendar systems, including the Umm Al Qura calendar and other observational and astronomical Hijri dating methods.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Document Islamic calendar systems in a neutral and structured manner
- Provide machine-readable Hijri date datasets
- Describe calculation and determination methodologies
- Provide stable definitions and references for Islamic calendar terminology
- Serve as the documentation and data backend for https://islamicdate.today

This repository is not a blog and not a news source. It is intended to function as a long-term reference and data documentation project.
